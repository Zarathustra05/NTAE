SRI - Never Trust An Elf

Basic Order of Use, to my Understanding:
You will 'Fork' the Repository 
you will 'Clone' that Forked Repository (this should populate your local folder)
Open up SRR Editor, open the Content Pack rom the GitHub folder you cloned to and get to work
'Commit' your changes locally with the GitHub GUI
'Sync' your changes to GitHub (cloud)
Then we can 'Merge' branches (not sure how as a team to best structure who and when we Merge stuff though)
