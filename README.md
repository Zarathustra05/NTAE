<H1>SRI - Never Trust An Elf

<b>Basic Order of Use, to my Understanding:<br><br></b>
You will 'Fork' the Repository<br>
you will 'Clone' that Forked Repository (this should populate your local folder)<br>
Open up SRR Editor, open the Content Pack rom the GitHub folder you cloned to and get to work<br>
'Commit' your changes locally with the GitHub GUI<br>
'Sync' your changes to GitHub (cloud)<br>
Then we can 'Merge' branches (not sure how as a team to best structure who and when we Merge stuff though)
